# Mysh

Mysh is a basic Unix shell written in Python for fun. It is a low-level implementation of a shell, directly using Unix system calls rather than higher-level abstractions available in Python. The shell supports piping commands, input and output redirection, shell variables, and more. The shell can also be treated as an executable (with the Python interpreter) to execute shell scripts.
